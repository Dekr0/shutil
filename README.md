# `shutil`

- This is a personal utility CLI that aims to simplify / automate the following:
    - `cd` to arbitrary directory
    - 
- This CLI is intended to use along with other CLI tools such as `fzf`, and with 
a few lines of script (either Bash or Power Shell) without using features or 
syntax that are specific to a scripting language.

## Motivation

- I want to reduce amount of mental load from maintaining a set of scripts that 
are written in two different scripting languages (bash and Power Shell), and 
from investing extra time to learn features specific to a scripting language (
mainly Power Shell).
